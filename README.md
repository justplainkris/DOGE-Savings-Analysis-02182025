# DOGE-Savings-Analysis-Update-02202025
Spreadsheet Updated Analysis of DOGE Savings Claims

Description
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the U.S. DOGE Service’s claimed savings. Using publicly available contract data from doge.gov/savings, this spreadsheet compares reported savings with actual contract and lease cancellations. The goal is to provide transparency by organizing the data in an easy-to-read format and allowing others to verify the numbers independently.

What’s Included
📊 Spreadsheet (.xlsx/.csv) – A detailed dataset that:
Breaks down DOGE’s savings claims with contract details and FPDS links
Includes contract types, obligations, and financial discrepancies
Categorizes contracts based on status (verified, mismatched, pending review)
Documents savings miscalculations and inconsistencies

How the Data Was Collected
✔️ Extracted Contract Links – Used browser developer tools to pull all contract links from the DOGE website.
✔️ Cross-Checked Data – Verified contract details against FPDS records.
✔️ Refined the Data – Cleaned up inconsistencies, added financial breakdowns, and flagged mismatched records.
✔️ Preserved Source Data – Archived original HTML pages for transparency in case DOGE updates or removes information.
While some FPDS links have been manually verified, not every contract has been reviewed line-by-line (see "How to Contribute" below to help expand the verification process).

Findings & Key Discrepancies
📌 DOGE’s claimed savings: $55 billion
📌 DOGE’s savings based on available contract data: $21.99 billion
📌 Verified total potential savings: $7.71 billion
📌 Revised savings estimate with stricter criteria: As low as $1.9 billion
📌 Discrepancy in reported vs. actual savings: Between $47.3B and $53.1B
This raises major concerns about how DOGE calculates its figures, particularly since some contracts were canceled for policy reasons rather than due to waste or fraud.

How to Contribute
Want to help verify and refine the data? Here’s how:
🔹 Download the spreadsheet (Click on the file → "Download raw")
🔹 Cross-check numbers & verify contract details with FPDS records
🔹 Submit corrections or additions by forking the repo and making a Pull Request (PR)
🔹 Report discrepancies in the "Issues" tab
🔹 Automate the verification – If you have a script or tool to speed up data validation, contributions are welcome!

Disclaimers
This analysis is based on publicly available data as of February 18, 2025. The dataset may change as DOGE updates its website. This project is independent and is not affiliated with any government agency.

What’s New in This Update?
✔️ Expanded contract details & categorization
✔️ Preserved source HTML pages for transparency
✔️ Stricter filtering for savings estimates
✔️ Revised discrepancy range ($47.3B–$53.1B)
✔️ New potential savings estimate: As low as $1.9B

Why This Matters
DOGE’s claimed savings numbers don’t add up—and now, with clearer data, we can see just how far off they really are. Let's hold them accountable.

Spreadsheet analysis of DOGE savings claims

Description
This repository contains an analysis of the U.S. DOGE Service’s claimed savings. 
Using publicly available contract data from doge.gov/savings, this spreadsheet compares the reported savings with actual contract and lease cancellations.
The goal is to provide transparency by organizing the data in an easy-to-read format and allowing others to verify the numbers.

What’s Included
Spreadsheet (.xlsx/.csv) – A cleaned-up version of the DOGE savings claims with contract details and FPDS links.

How the Data Was Collected
Extracted Links – Used browser developer tools to pull all contract links from the DOGE website.
Cross-Checked Data – Verified contract links against FPDS records.
Organized in a Spreadsheet – Cleaned up data, added missing values, and checked for discrepancies. 
While I verified some FPDS links, I have not manually checked every single one for accuracy (see how to contribute below to help).

Findings
DOGE claims $55 billion in savings.
Verified contract/lease cancellations total $22.07 billion.
Discrepancy of $32.93 billion in reported vs. actual savings.
This raises concerns about how DOGE calculates its figures, especially since some contracts are legitimately canceled for policy reasons, not fraud or waste.

How to Contribute
If you want to verify or expand the analysis, you can:
Download the spreadsheet (click on the file → "Download raw").
Review the numbers & cross-check links with FPDS records.
Submit corrections or additions by forking the repo and making a Pull Request (PR).
Report discrepancies in the "Issues" tab.
If you have a script or tool to automate data verification, that would be even better!

Disclaimers
