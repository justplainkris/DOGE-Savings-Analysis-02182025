Spreadsheet analysis of DOGE savings claims

Description
This repository contains an analysis of the U.S. DOGE Service’s claimed savings. 
Using publicly available contract data from doge.gov/savings, this spreadsheet compares the reported savings with actual contract and lease cancellations.
The goal is to provide transparency by organizing the data in an easy-to-read format and allowing others to verify the numbers.

What’s Included
Spreadsheet (.xlsx/.csv) – A cleaned-up version of the DOGE savings claims with contract details and FPDS links.

How the Data Was Collected
Extracted Links – Used browser developer tools to pull all contract links from the DOGE website.
Cross-Checked Data – Verified contract links against FPDS records.
Organized in a Spreadsheet – Cleaned up data, added missing values, and checked for discrepancies. 
While I verified some FPDS links, I have not manually checked every single one for accuracy (see how to contribute below to help).

Findings
DOGE claims $55 billion in savings.
Verified contract/lease cancellations total $22.07 billion.
Discrepancy of $32.93 billion in reported vs. actual savings.
This raises concerns about how DOGE calculates its figures, especially since some contracts are legitimately canceled for policy reasons, not fraud or waste.

How to Contribute
If you want to verify or expand the analysis, you can:
Download the spreadsheet (click on the file → "Download raw").
Review the numbers & cross-check links with FPDS records.
Submit corrections or additions by forking the repo and making a Pull Request (PR).
Report discrepancies in the "Issues" tab.
If you have a script or tool to automate data verification, that would be even better!
